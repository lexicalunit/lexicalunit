% TODO:
% 1. Visually uneven?
% 2. Resume doesn't include a summary section -- the key component to compel the
%    hiring manager to keep reading. The career summary content should provide
%    hiring managers with a brief, yet detailed synopsis of what you bring to
%    the table. The purpose of this section is to define you as a professional
%    and cover those areas most relevant to your career level and job target.
% 3. From the wording of the resume, you come across as a "doer," not an
%    "achiever." Too man-y of your job descriptions are task-based and not
%    results-based. This means that they tell what you did, instead of what you
%    achieved. This is a common mistake for non- professional resume writers.
%    To be effective and create excitement, a great resume helps the hiring
%    executive picture you delivering similar achievements at his or her
%    company. Here are some examples of task-based sentences in your resume:
%    - "Worked with services using Ruby, Python, Scala, Kafka, ..."
%    - "Architected aggregation service built on Druid.io, ..."
% 4. Employers want to know about your previous contributions and specifically
%    how youâ€™ve made a difference. More importantly, they want to know how you
%    are going to make a significant difference at their company.
